      <h3>What is Mental Health?</h3>
      <p>Mental health is about how you think, feel, and deal with problems on a daily basis â€” not just about being happy. It's the foundation of how we process emotions, handle stress, build relationships, and make decisions.</p>
      
      <div class="icon-list">
        <div class="icon-item">
          <span class="material-icons">balance</span>
          <span>Balance your thoughts</span>
        </div>
        <div class="icon-item">
          <span class="material-icons">self_improvement</span>
          <span>Manage your stress</span>

          <span class="material-icons">groups</span>
          <span>Stay connected</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>Mental health influences how we study, work, and connect with others. Everyone's experience is different â€” shaped by our emotions, relationships, environment, and personal history. Just like physical health, mental health exists on a spectrum and can change over time.</p>
      
      <p>Taking care of our mental health is just as important as caring for our physical health. It's not about being perfect or always feeling positive â€” it's about building resilience, seeking support when needed, and creating habits that help us thrive. With the right tools, environment, and community, we can all work toward better balance and well-being.</p>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Mental health challenges are common, especially among students. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You're not alone in this journey.</p>

      <h3>Common Causes of Student Stress</h3>
      <p>College life can feel like a constant balancing act â€” juggling classes, assignments, social life, and personal responsibilities. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Understanding what causes stress is the first step toward managing it effectively.</p>
      
      <p>Some of the most common stressors among students include:</p>

        <li><strong>Academic Pressure</strong> - Heavy workloads, back-to-back exams, tight deadlines, and the constant pressure to perform well can create anxiety and exhaustion. The fear of failure or not meeting expectations â€” whether from yourself, family, or professors â€” adds to the mental load.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship Challenges</strong> - Conflicts or misunderstandings with friends, classmates, romantic partners, or family members can deeply affect emotional balance. Feeling isolated, misunderstood, or unsupported can make stress feel even heavier.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Strain</strong> - Worrying about daily expenses, tuition fees, rent, bills, and other costs can create constant background stress. For many students, financial insecurity affects not just their budget, but also their mental peace and ability to focus on studies.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Imposed Pressure</strong> - Expecting too much from yourself, comparing your progress to others on social media, or feeling like you're not doing enough can lead to burnout, anxiety, or depression. Perfectionism and imposter syndrome are common struggles among high-achieving students.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep Deprivation</strong> - Late-night study sessions, endless scrolling through social media, or irregular sleep schedules drain your focus, energy, and emotional resilience. Lack of quality sleep makes it harder to manage stress and can worsen mental health symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty About the Future</strong> - Questions about career paths, job prospects, and life after graduation can create anxiety. The pressure to "figure it all out" while still in school can feel overwhelming.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Recognizing these stressors is important â€” but remember, stress doesn't have to control your life. There are healthy ways to cope, and you don't have to face it alone.</p>
      
      <h3>Healthy Coping Habits</h3>
      <p>Stress is a natural part of student life â€” but it doesn't have to overwhelm you. Building healthy coping habits can help you manage pressure, protect your mental health, and maintain balance. Here are simple, practical ways to recharge your mind and body:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Rest</strong> - Take short breaks between study sessions, nap when your body needs it, and don't feel guilty for resting. Your brain needs recovery time to process information and maintain focus. Quality rest improves memory, creativity, and emotional regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Journaling</strong> - Write down your thoughts, emotions, worries, or daily wins. Journaling helps you process what you're feeling, identify patterns in your mood, and track your personal growth over time. It's a safe space to be honest with yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Talk to Someone</strong> - Open up to friends, family, mentors, counselors, or support groups. Sharing your struggles lightens the emotional weight and reminds you that you're not alone. Sometimes, just being heard can make a huge difference.</li>
        <li><strong>Try Deep Breathing</strong> - Practice slow, intentional breathing exercises or short mindfulness breaks. Even one minute of calm, focused breathing can reduce anxiety, lower your heart rate, and help you regain clarity during stressful moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Move Your Body</strong> - Physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally boost mood and reduce stress. You don't need intense workouts â€” stretching, walking, jogging, dancing, or yoga all help. Find what feels good for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to Music</strong> - Play your favorite soothing or uplifting playlist. Music can help reset your emotions, improve focus, and provide comfort during difficult times. Create playlists for different moods â€” study, relaxation, motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage in Hobbies</strong> - Do something beyond academics that brings you joy â€” paint, cook, garden, play games, read for pleasure, or learn a new skill. Hobbies give your mind a break and remind you that you're more than your grades.</li>
        <li><strong>Go Offline</strong> - Take intentional breaks from screens and social media. Constant connectivity can drain your energy and increase comparison anxiety. Reconnect with the real world â€” spend time in nature, have face-to-face conversations, or simply enjoy quiet moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Establish a Routine</strong> - Create a daily structure that includes time for studying, self-care, meals, and sleep. Routines provide stability and reduce decision fatigue, making it easier to manage stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Professional Help When Needed</strong> - If stress becomes overwhelming or persistent, don't hesitate to reach out to a counselor, therapist, or mental health professional. Asking for help is a courageous and important step toward healing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Study Smart Tips</h3>
      <p>Studying doesn't have to mean burnout. Working smarter, not harder, helps you retain information better, stay focused longer, and protect your mental health. These evidence-based strategies can transform how you approach learning:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> - Study for 25 minutes with full focus, then take a 5-minute break. After four rounds, reward yourself with a longer 15-30 minute rest. This method prevents mental fatigue, maintains concentration, and makes large tasks feel more manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-Blocking</strong> - Schedule specific hours for studying, resting, meals, exercise, and personal time. Visualizing your day helps you balance productivity with wellness. Use planners, calendars, or apps to stay organized and avoid last-minute cramming.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Note-Taking Methods</strong> - Try techniques like Cornell Notes (divide pages into cues, notes, and summary), Mind Mapping (visual diagrams connecting ideas), or the Feynman Technique (explain concepts in simple terms). Active engagement improves understanding and retention.</li>
        <li><strong>5-Minute Focus Reset</strong> - When you feel distracted or overwhelmed, pause for five minutes. Stand up, stretch, breathe deeply, look away from screens, and let go of tension. This quick reset clears your mind and boosts concentration for the next study session.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Study Apps Wisely</strong> - Apps like Notion, Forest, Todoist, Anki, or Quizlet can keep you organized, focused, and motivated. However, remember they're tools to support learning â€” not distractions or substitutes for actual studying. Set boundaries to avoid app overload.</li>
        <li><strong>Study in Intervals, Not Marathons</strong> - Avoid long, exhausting study sessions. Break material into smaller chunks and spread learning over multiple days. Spaced repetition (reviewing material at increasing intervals) significantly improves long-term retention.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Dedicated Study Space</strong> - Designate a specific area for studying â€” ideally quiet, well-lit, and free from distractions. Your brain will associate this space with focus and productivity, making it easier to get into "study mode."</li>
        <li><strong>Teach What You Learn</strong> - Explaining concepts to others (or even to yourself out loud) reinforces understanding and reveals gaps in knowledge. Study groups or teaching sessions can make learning more interactive and enjoyable.</li>
        <li><strong>Know When to Stop</strong> - Productivity is about consistency and quality, not exhaustion. If you're too tired to focus, continuing won't help. Rest when your body or mind says so â€” tomorrow's fresh start will be more effective than tonight's burnout.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins</strong> - Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. Finished a chapter? Completed an assignment? Showed up even when you didn't feel like it? Celebrate it. Positive reinforcement builds motivation and resilience.</li>
      </ul>
